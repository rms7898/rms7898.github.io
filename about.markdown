<h2><span style="color: #550000;"><em>Colophon's</em> Rich Legacy at Towson High School</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The students and faculty of <strong>Towson High School</strong> began <em>Colophon</em> in the 1960s.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From its humble beginnings as a simple chapbook, containing two dozen or so student poems and a few black line sketches, <em>Colophon</em> has since grown into a national award-winning annual publication with a growing digital presence that features a wide range of quality works in photography, sculpture, painting, poetry, prose and drama.&nbsp; Many of the works and artists published in <em>Colophon</em> have won individual awards and acclaim through their efforts, some going on to achieve greater recognition as they continued to explore and define their artistic talents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As <em>Colophon</em> embarks on the next 50+ years of publishing, we will work to ensure that magazine continues to explore and develop on its original purpose - to give the students of <strong>Towson High School</strong> and chance to share and enjoy in the thriving creative culture that its students cultivate each and every year.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this new era of publication and imagination we hope, also, to bring the community of <strong>Towson</strong> closer together by reaching both back and forward, building bridges to connect the rich legacy of our past with the endless potential of the future.</p>
